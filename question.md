Things to think about

1. What does $\text{Lie}(SU(n) \otimes SU(m))$ looks like? maybe $\mathfrak{su}(n) \otimes \mathfrak{su}(m)$?

2. Two decomposition is isomorphic if $P\ell_iP^\dagger$ and $Pm_iP^\dagger$. Can I rederive the magic basis?

3. If $\mathfrak{h}, \mathfrak{h}^\prime$ are two maximal abelian subalgebra of $\mathfrak{m}$ can the intersection $\mathfrak{h} \cap \mathfrak{h}^\prime$ be bigger than {0}

4. See if I can make any progress on $\dim(\mathfrak{m}) - \dim(\mathfrak{h}) \leq \dim(\mathfrak{k})$
